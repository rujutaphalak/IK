/**
 * Count ways to reach the Nâ€™th stair
 *
 *
 *
 * Problem Statement:
 *
 *
 *
 * (This is simple. Make me proud.)
 *
 *
 *
 * There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. He can climb a certain number of steps at once. For instance, the person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top.
 *
 *
 *
 * Note: Solve the problem for general case i.e. for n stairs, and different kinds of steps that can be taken (e.g. instead of only 1 or 2 steps, it could be 2, 3 and 5 steps at a time).
 *
 *
 *
 * Input/Output Format For The Function:
 *
 *
 *
 * Input Format:
 *
 *
 *
 * There will be two arguments: steps and n.
 *
 * An array of integer steps denotes the steps the person can climb at a time and an integer n denotes the total number of stairs to be climbed.
 *
 *
 *
 * Note: Answer is guaranteed to fit in long integer.
 *
 *
 *
 * Output Format:
 *
 *
 *
 * Return an integer ways, denoting the number of ways to reach the last staircase.
 *
 *
 *
 * Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:
 *
 *
 *
 * Input Format:
 *
 *
 *
 * The first line should contain m(let say), denoting size of steps array. In next m lines, ith line should contain steps[i], denoting ith value in array steps. In the next line, there should be an integer, denoting n.
 *
 *
 *
 * If n = 7 and steps = [2, 3], then input should be:
 *
 *
 *
 * 2
 *
 * 2
 *
 * 3
 *
 * 7
 *
 *
 *
 * Output Format:
 *
 *
 *
 * There will be one line, containing an integer ways, denoting the number of ways to reach the last staircase.
 *
 *
 *
 * For input n = 7 and steps = [2, 3], output will be:
 *
 *
 *
 * 2
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * 1 <= steps <= 10000
 * All values in steps will be unique. There are no duplicate entries.
 *
 *
 * Sample Test Cases:
 *
 *
 *
 * Sample Test Case 1:
 *
 *
 *
 * Sample Input 1:
 *
 *
 *
 * n = 1
 *
 * steps = [1, 2]
 *
 *
 *
 * Sample Output 1:
 *
 *
 *
 * 1
 *
 *
 *
 * Explanation 1:
 *
 *
 *
 * Only one way to reach = [{1}]
 *
 *
 *
 * Sample Test Case 2:
 *
 *
 *
 * Sample Input 2:
 *
 *
 *
 * n = 2
 *
 * steps = [1, 2]
 *
 *
 *
 * Sample Output 2:
 *
 *
 *
 * 2
 *
 *
 *
 * Explanation 2:
 *
 *
 *
 * Two ways to reach = [{1, 1}, {2}]
 *
 *
 *
 * Sample Test Case 3:
 *
 *
 *
 * Sample Input 3:
 *
 *
 *
 * n = 7
 *
 * steps = [2, 3]
 *
 *
 *
 * Sample Output 3:
 *
 *
 *
 * 3
 *
 *
 *
 * Explanation 3:
 *
 *
 *
 * Three ways to reach = [{2, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 2}, {3, 2, 2}]

 Let us try to solve this problem for 1, 2 and 3 stairs.



 Recursive solution



 We will denote s(n) as the number of ways to reach nth stair using given stairs, which would be 1, 2 and 3 in our explanation.



 We can reach n from n-1, n-2 and n-3 by adding 1 stair of 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

 Thus we get the following relationship



 s(n) = s(n-1) + s(n-2) + s(n-3)



 Base case would be 0. We can reach 0 by only starting there. Thus, s(0) = 1





 Optimal solution



 We can memoize the recurrence relationship mentioned above or build an iterative version for the same problem.

 We can see for any random stair x, s(x) depends on s(y), where y < x. Thus we can iteratively move from 0 to n and at each step we can have

 s[x] = s[x-1] + s[x-2] + s[x-3]

 and s[n] will be the final answer.





 Space Complexity: O(n*length(steps))

 Time Complexity: O(n*(length(steps))
